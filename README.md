# -GROMACS-MD-The-miscible-process-of-CO2-C8
In this project, The force field of TraPPE-UA &amp; OPLS-AA is utilized to simulate the CO2&amp;C8H18 miscible process respectively.

## TraPPEUA_demo directory
The files in this folder are based on the TraPPE-UA force field. This force field is well suited for small molecules and alkane molecules. When the temperature and pressure are below the critical temperature and pressure of carbon dioxide, the simulation presents remarkable splitting phenomenon and the interfacial tension is about 6-10mN/m.The immiscible case is shown as below

Uplifting the pressure, the interfacial tension decreases sharply. The interfacial tension is close to zero when the pressure reaches about 8.5MPa. Therefore the minimum miscible pressure (MMP) is about 8.5MPa.The miscible case is shown as below

## OPLS-AA directory
The files in this folder are based on the OPLS-AA force field. This force field is widely used in various cases. However, in this case, this force field cannot present immiscible phenomenon even at very low pressure. So if you want to simulate well, you'd better not use this force field.

- The topology files are partly generated by `AuToFF`,but later you should revise the files by yourself according to the specification. You can visit the website below.
