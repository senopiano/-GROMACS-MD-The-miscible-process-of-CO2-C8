## TraPPEUA_demo directory
The files in this folder are based on the TraPPE-UA force field. This force field is well suited for small molecules and alkane molecules. When the temperature and pressure are below the critical temperature and pressure of carbon dioxide, the simulation presents remarkable splitting phenomenon and the interface pressure is about 6-10mN/m.
